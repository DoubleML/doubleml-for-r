# DoubleML - Double Machine Learning in python and R

The R package **DoubleML** provides an implementation of the double / debiased machine learning framework of [Chernozhukov et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00060). It is built on top of [mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/) and the [mlr3 ecosystem](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/wiki/Extension-Packages) (Lang et al., 2019). 

Note that the R package was developed together with a python twin based on [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). The python package is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DoubleML/doubleml-for-py). 

## Documentation and maintenance 

Documentation of functions in R: `here`

User guide: [http://doubleml.org](http://doubleml.org)

**DoubleML** is currently maintained by [`@MalteKurz`](https://github.com/MalteKurz) and [`@PhilippBach`](https://github.com/PhilippBach). 

## Main Features

Double / debiased machine learning framework of [Chernozhukov et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00060) for 

* Partially linear regression models (PLR)
* Partially linear IV regression models (PLIV)
* Interactive regression models (IRM)
* Interactive IV regression models (IIVM)



The object-oriented implementation of **DoubleML** that is based on the [R6 package for R](https://r6.r-lib.org/) is very flexible. The model classes `DoubleMLPLR`, `DoubleMLPLIV`, `DoubleMLIRM` and `DoubleIIVM` implement the estimation of the nuisance functions via machine learning methods and the computation of the Neyman orthogonal score function. All other functionalities are implemented in the abstract base class `DoubleML`. In particular functionalities to estimate double machine learning models and to perform statistical inference via the methods `fit`, `bootstrap`, `confint`, `p_adjust` and `tune`. This object-oriented implementation allows a high flexibility for the model specification in terms of ...

* ... the machine learners for the nuisance functions,
* ... the resampling schemes,
* ... the double machine learning algorithm,
* ... the Neyman orthogonal score functions,
* ...

It further can be readily extended with regards to

* ... new model classes that come with Neyman orthogonal score functions being linear in the target parameter,
* ... alternative score functions via callables,
* ... alternative resampling schemes,
* ...

## Installation 

**DoubleML** requires 

* R
* R6
* mlr3
* mlr3tuning
* mlr3learners
* data.table
* paradox
* stats
* utils
* clusterGeneration
* foreign (<= 0.8-76)

We plan to push a first release of the **DoubleML** package to CRAN very soon.

Until then we recommend to install from source via 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("DoubleML/doubleml-for-r")
```
