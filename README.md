# DoubleML - Double Machine Learning in R

**Some Introductory Text**

The `DoubleML` package for R provides an implementation of the double
machine learning framework of [Chernozhukov et
al.Â (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00060)

List of functionalities provided:

  - Double Machine Learning with a variety of learners

  - Easy to extend, e.g., incorporating new scores and models

List of characteristics of implementation

  - Based on the powerful R package [mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/)
    and related packages such as
    [mlr3learner](https://mlr3learners.mlr-org.com/) and
    [mlr3tuning](https://mlr3tuning.mlr-org.com/)

  - Object oriented implemnetation based on [R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/)
  
  ## Getting Started: Installation
  
Install the R package by the command 

```
remotes::install_github("DoubleML/doubleml-for-r")
```
