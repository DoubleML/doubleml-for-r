}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame.}

\item{y}{Name of outcome variable. The variable must be included in \code{data}.}

\item{d}{Name of treatment variables for which inference should be performed.}

\item{z}{List with names of instrumental variables. For each treatment variable in d, one instrument must be specified.}

\item{model}{Inference model to be implemented, e.g. partially linear regression (\code{plr}), partially linear instrumental variable regression (\code{plriv}) (default).}

\item{k}{Number of folds for \code{k}-fold cross-fitting (default \code{k}=2).}

\item{S}{number of repetitions (default \code{S=1}.}

\item{resampling}{Resampling scheme for cross-fitting of class \code{\link[mlr3]{ResamplingCV}}.}

\item{mlmethod}{If multiple target coefficients are provided and different mlmethods chosen for each coefficient, the names of the methods are required to match. A list of available methods is available at \url{https://mlr.mlr-org.com/articles/tutorial/integrated_learners.html}.}

\item{dml_procedure}{Double machine learning algorithm to be used, either \code{"dml1"} or \code{"dml2"} (default).}

\item{params}{If multiple target coefficients are provided and different mlmethods chosen for each coefficient, the names of the methods are required to match.}

\item{inf_model}{Inference model for final estimation, default \code{"IV-type"} (...)}

\item{se_type}{Method to estimate standard errors. Default \code{"ls"} to estimate usual standard error from least squares regression of residuals. Alternatively, specify \code{"IV-type"} or \code{"DML2018"} to obtain standard errors that correspond to the specified \code{inf_model}. The options chosen for \code{inf_model} and \code{se_type} are required to match.}

\item{bootstrap}{Choice for implementation of multiplier bootstrap, can be set to \code{"normal"} (by default), \code{"none"}, \code{"Bayes"}, \code{"wild"}.}

\item{nRep}{Number of repetitions for multiplier bootstrap, by default \code{nRep=500}.}

\item{aggreg_median}{logical indicating how target estimators and standard errors should be aggregated for repeated cross-fitting. By default (\code{TRUE}), the median over all estimators as taken as the final estimator. If \code{FALSE}, the mean is calculated over all estimators.}

\item{...}{further options passed to underlying functions.}
}
\value{
Result object of class \code{DML} with estimated coefficient and standard errors.

\description{
